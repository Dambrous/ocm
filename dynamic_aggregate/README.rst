Dynamic Aggregate
=================

The Dynamic Aggregate module facilitates dynamic aggregation under the list/tree view in Odoo. Users can define configurations to compute values based on specified operations and columns, and display the computed result in a chosen target column.

* Example: Percentage (Total sum of one column divide by the total sum of another column and formatted with the percentage

* Example: Multiplication (Total sum of one column multiplied by the total sum of another column and formatted with the currency symbol (selected)

* Example: Sum (Maximum value of one column + minimum of another column formatted as float

Configuration
-------------

After installing the `dynamic_aggregate` module, follow these steps to configure it:

1. Navigate to `Settings` -> `Dynamic Aggregate Settings`.
2. Click `Create` to add a new aggregation configuration.
3. Configure the following settings:

   - **Label**: Select the label of field when hovering over the result.
   - **Model**: Select the model for which you want to configure dynamic aggregation.
   - **Target Column**: Choose the target column where the computed value should be displayed.
   - **Operation**: Select from addition (+), subtraction (-), division (/), or multiplication (*).
   - **Target 1**: Choose first target of operation (must be of type float, integer, or monetary).
   - **Target 2**: Choose second target of operation (must be of type float, integer, or monetary).
   - **Target 1 Aggregate Function**: Select the aggregation function for each of the chosen columns (`sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`)
   - **Target 2 Aggregate Function**: Select the aggregation function for each of the chosen columns (`sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max)
   - **Format Type**: Choose the formatting type for the computed value (monetary, float, integer, percentage).
   - **Digits**: Specify the number of decimal places for the formatted result.

4. Save the configuration.

Usage Example
-------------

Suppose you want to calculate the exact percentage between two columns by taking the sum of each column and formatting it as a percentage. Hereâ€™s how you can configure it:

1. Navigate to the `Dynamic Aggregate` module from the homepage.
2. Create a new configuration:
   - **Model**: Choose the model(in this case sale.planning.line).
   - **Target Column**: Select the target column where you want to display the percentage.
   - **Operation**: Choose `/` (division).
   - **Target 1**: Select the first target of the first dataset.
   - **Target 2**: Select the second target of the second dataset.
   - **Target 1/2 Aggregate Function**: Choose `sum` for both target columns.
   - **Format Type**: Select `percentage`.
   - **Decimal Precision**: Specify the precision (e.g., 2 for two decimal places).

3. Save the configuration.

In this example, the module computes the exact percentage between the sums of two columns and displays the result formatted as a percentage, which Odoo does not directly support.

Features
--------

- Dynamic aggregation of data under list/tree view in Odoo.
- Supports operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
- Allows selection of columns and their respective aggregation methods (sum, min, max, avg).
- Flexible formatting options including monetary, float, integer, and percentage with customizable decimal precision.


**IMPORTANT: Aggregates can only be managed in the list view.**
